BlueChecker will help you audit PowerShell and check for any suspicious activity. At the end it will then generate a report. Default location: C:\Temp\report.html

Simply download the script or run remotely using:

powershell –nop –c “iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securethelogs/Bluechecker/master/BlueChecker.ps1’)”

Once ran, BlueChecker will check for:

* Powershell status
* Evidence of downgrading
* Registry and GP set for PowerShell auditing
* Malicious scripts using keywords
* Firewall spesific to Powershell
* Event logs for Module logging and script block logging.
